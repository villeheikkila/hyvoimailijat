## Infrastructure

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **Database:** D1
- **Storage:** R2
- **Framework:** Astro with `@astrojs/cloudflare`

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm refresh:staging
pnpm dev
```

By default, local Astro uses remote bindings to the isolated staging D1 and R2
resources. `pnpm refresh:staging` replaces staging D1 from production. Production
is read-only during the refresh. Authentication, sessions, audit logs, plugin
state, form submissions, and the production site URL are deliberately excluded.

The staging R2 bucket has already been initialized. Include media only after new
production uploads, since bulk media copying is necessarily slower:

Useful options:

```bash
pnpm refresh:staging -- --with-media
pnpm refresh:staging -- --media-only --resume-media
pnpm refresh:staging -- --dry-run
```

For a fully local, offline copy instead:

```bash
pnpm refresh:local
pnpm dev:local
```

For local admin access without reapplying demo seed content, use:

```text
http://localhost:4321/_emdash/api/auth/dev-bypass?redirect=/_emdash/admin
```

## Deploying

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

Or click the deploy button above to set up the project in your Cloudflare account.
